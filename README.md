Mine Sweeper is a game in which the player reveals tiles by clicking on them, among these tiles are hidden mines, if the player reveals a mine they lose. Revealed tiles show the number of mines in the surrounding tiles. The player wins by flagging all of the mine tiles correctly.

I chose this game because of the recursive aspects, and the challenge they bring to the project seemed like fun to solve and code. Also I really dislike Checkers.
